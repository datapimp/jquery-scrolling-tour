jQuery Scrolling Tour
=====================

This plugin combines jQuery-scrollTo with code inspired by CoDrops
tooltip demo. 

The concept is that on a page, you have several scenes which are not all
available within the viewport, and within these scenes there are points
of interest, which you overlay explanatory tooltips.

This plugin allows you to create guided tours of a page.  

As you navigate through the tooltips and change scenes, the plugin uses
jQuery-scrollTo animation to navigate from scene to scene.
